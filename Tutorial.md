## Tutorial
1. Preparing  for shiny app.<br>
* Download `ups1-uniprot-comet-proteomics_lfq.zip` from [this page](https://github.com/bigbio/pquant/issues/7), we need `out_msstats.csv` in this zip.<br>
* Download `shiny-app` folder from [this page](https://github.com/Douerww/pquantR/tree/main/shiny-app) and put it in a suitable working path.
2. Run `app.R` in the shiny-app folder, and you could run it in the following ways.<br>
* Use RStudio to open app.R file, and click the `Run App` button.<br>
* Enter the following command in RStudio to run the shiny app:<br>
```r
setwd(getwd())  # The path where you store this R script
shiny::runApp('./shiny-app')
```
3. Click the `Browse` button to upload ‘out. CSV ‘file, then you can view the contents of the file, the resulting volcano map, heat map, and QC map through four different buttons in the shiny app.<br>

## Current problems
1. All 3 plots are generated by the MSStats R package, and when we click plot button, getPlots.R will run again which make us feel stuck.
2. Cannot view all plots in Volcano and QC plot, because only one image can be viewed at a time in the window.
3. Because of the large number of proteins in our data and the long names, showing them in a volcano map would affect the effect. Consider not displaying the name in the future.
