Protocol Description	The LC-MS/MS analysis was performed using the Dionex Ultimate 3000 RSLC nanoLC system coupled to a Q-Exactive apparatus (Thermo Fisher, MA). 5μl sample was injected into an acclaim peptide trap column via the autosampler of the Dionex RSLC nanoLC system. Mobile phase A (0.1% FA in 5% ACN) and mobile phase B (0.1% FA in ACN) were used to establish a 60 min gradient. The flow rate was maintained at 300 nl/min. Peptides were analyzed on a Dionex EASY-spray column (PepMap® C18, 3um, 100A) using an EASY nanospray source at an electrospray potential of 1.5 kV. MS scan (350–1600 m/z range) was acquired at a resolution of 70,000 at m/z 200, with a maximum ion accumulation time of 100 ms. Dynamic exclusion was set to 30 s. Resolution for MS/MS spectra was set to 35,000 at m/z 200. The AGC setting was 1E6 for the full MS scan and 2E5 for the MS2 scan. The 10 most intense ions above a 1000 count threshold were selected for HCD fragmentation, with a maximum ion accumulation time of 120 ms. An isolation width of 2 Da was used for the MS2 scan. Single and unassigned charged ions were excluded from MS/MS. For HCD, normalized collision energy was set to 28. The underfill ratio was defined as 0.1%.	Frozen brain samples of the medial frontal gyrus from AD patients and age-matched controls were obtained from Netherlands Brain Bank, Meibergdreef 47, 1105 BA Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The scientific use of the human material was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, and informed consent was obtained from all patients or the guardians of the patients prior to donation of brain tissues upon their death. All procedures were approved and performed in accordance with the ethical guidelines of the Nanyang Technological University ethics board.
